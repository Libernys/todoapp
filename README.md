TODO App
=========

This TODO Application was developed using Sprint Boot and Angular. It Allows to:
1.	List all TODOs with the done TODO at the end of the list.
2.	Each TODO have a title a description and state (done or not).
3.	The state of each TODO can be changed in the list. If a TODO is changed to Done its moved to the end of the list. 
4.	The app allows to create, update and delete TODOs. Every time a TODO is added it is added inserted at the top of the list. 
5.	There are two additional options to delete the TODOs done or all the TODOS.
6.	The application includes the possibility to search by TITLE.

By default, the Application inserts 4 TODOs when the back-end is started and uses the H2 database embedded within the application.
